# Word-API
A simple web application in which  user will get description of selected word

In this Web app the Json file is stored locally.
This is my learing stage, currently learning fetch API
Here I am usinig async await and fetch API to access the Json data. In other words we are pretending that we are using a link from a server to fetch the data.
Thats it.
I think there can be a improvement in option tag, by using Js. But I don't want to do it now.
If you can do any kind improvement, you are free to contribute. I would love to push you code.

Thanks for reading.
